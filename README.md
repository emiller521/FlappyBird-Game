# FlappyBird-Game
Recreation of the classic 2013 mobile game Flappy Birds

To run this program, you must follow these simple instructions:

1. run "pipenv install" in command line to install virtual enviornment where the game is going to run 

2. run "pipenv run python flappy.py" to run the file which holds all the code

I wanted to build upon my Python coding skills so chose to remake a game that I missed playing grow up, and it turned out pretty well. Check it out!
